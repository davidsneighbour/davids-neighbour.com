## How much do you cost?

This depends on a number of factors. Specifically but not limited to, project size, my role in the project and whether there is ongoing work to be had. As a general rule, I charge 100/hour and don't take projects under 3k.

## Can your provide hosting?

Yes, absolutely. I have a lot of experience with WordPress hosting and would be happy to provide a number of different options.

## Can you give a fixed quote?

Providing you provide proper project specs and designs (if applicable), I can provide an estimate for your project broken out by line item.

## Where are you from?

I grew up just North of Boston. I left for boarding school in '96 and never moved back. I miss the seafood, Fall and Fenway Park. I don't miss the weather.
