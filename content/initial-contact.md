1. Did you book a consultation with me because of an incident that concerns you, or because you just want to see how to keep improving?
This question can help narrow the scope of the conversation, sooner rather than later.  It may expand into other topics again, even if there’s one specific problem you try to figure out, but at least you’ll start with a clearer goal in mind.
2.  IF there’s been a drop-off in rankings or traffic, has it corresponded to a drop in customers and/or leads?
For starters, this one gives a sense of how dependent the business is on search-engine visibility.
3.  What do you see in Google Analytics?
Helps to determine how bad a possible drop-off really was, or whether.
4.  How do you currently get most of your customers / clients / patients?
5.  What SEO work have you done so far? If you hired an SEO company, what work did they do, specifically?
You need to know of skeletons in the closet.
6.  What are you working on now, exactly?
7.  What work do you plan to do, but haven’t gotten around to yet?
For instance, “I know I need to rustle up some good links, but am not sure where to start.”  This question is always telling.
8.  Are there any activities you’ve stopped or slowed down on?
Sometimes the best move is to resume X and not to bother with Y.
9.  Have you changed any of your basic business info? Name, address, phone number, or URL?
Changes like those can jostle your rankings, particularly in Google Maps.
10.  Have you recently redesigned your site, or do you plan to?
Visibility / traffic rarely improves after a redesign.  Usually it’s followed by (a) more of the same or (b) a drop-off.  This is a good time to run down my quick checklist.
11.  What’s been your process for earning links?
You may want to bring this up very early in the call.  It’s usually one of the problems – if not the problem.  Especially if a big goof-up is not apparent.
12.  What’s been your process for encouraging reviews?
Bad reviews or a lack of reviews often explains (at least partly) why the rankings see-saw but business is always down.  See this.  Rankings without reviews don’t amount to much, usually.
13.  Does one location outperform the other?
Often one location uses a more-ideal landing page, or has more/better reviews, or significantly cleaner citations, or more good links relevant to it.
